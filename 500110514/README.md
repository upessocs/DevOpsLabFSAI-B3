## Introduction

This repository contains Shri Radhey Mishra's DevOps Lab work. It showcases the concepts learned and the practical implementations done throughout the lab sessions.

## Concepts Learned

### 1. Git

Git is an open-source distributed version control system. We first installed Git on our local system and created an account on [GitHub](https://github.com).

We learned some basic Git commands, such as:

- **git init**: Initializes a Git repository on your local machine. Run this once per project.
- **git status**: Shows the current status of your Git repository.
- **git clone**: Copies a repository to your local machine.
  ```bash
  git clone "https://remainder_of_url"
  ```
- **echo "content" >> filename**: Creates a file and adds content to it.
- **git add**: Stages changes for the next commit.
- **git commit**: Records the staged changes to the local repository with a message:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```
- **git push**: Uploads local repository content to a remote repository.

### 2. Git Submodules

We also explored Git submodules, which allow you to include and manage external repositories inside another repository.

- **Repo1**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/Repo1)  
  Also added to GitHub Pages: [Repo1 GitHub Pages](https://shriradhey-mishra.github.io/Repo1/MAIN)  
- **Repo2**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/Repo2)  
- **Repo3**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/Repo3)  

---

### 3. GitHub Pages

We used GitHub Pages to host static web pages directly from a GitHub repository.

- **GitHub Pages Repository**: [ShriRadhey-Mishra.github.io](https://github.com/ShriRadhey-Mishra/ShriRadhey-Mishra.github.io)  
- **Live Page**: [View the deployed page](https://shriradhey-mishra.github.io/)
